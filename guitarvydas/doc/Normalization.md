Once you recognize a pattern,
1. How do you store it?
2. How do you query the stored information?

# Storing Information
## Storing Information - Normalization
What if you could store information in a language agnostic manner?  

Ideally, we use pattern matching to grok the information, then we write it out in some standard format.

You want to "normalize" the information, so that it was always stored in the same format regardless of where it came from.

Say, JSON.

## Querying Information - Pattern Matching (Again)

What if you could query information in a language agnostic manner?
