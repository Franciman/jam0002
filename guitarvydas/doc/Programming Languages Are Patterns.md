Programming Languages are patterns for controlling machines (computers).

We can control a machine by toggling it using a bank of switches.

We can convert the bank of switches into something more convenient, e.g. a bank of characters that are converted into switching control (of the computer).

When we do this recursively, we end up with progamming languages.

Programs written in high-level programming languages are converted to lower-level banks of characters which are then converted into switching control (e.g. C++ to ASM to binary codes for controlling computers).

All languages that produce code for a particular CPU, funnel down to the same binary codes (regardless of which programming language they were written in originally).

The goal of projectional editing is to find a way to *normalize* all programs into a common form that can be easily edited (queried - editing starts with querying).
