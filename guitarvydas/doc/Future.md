- Write a cmm preprocessor that uses a macro specification.  For example, instead of writing the macros in Ohm, we could write them in .cmmmac format, then use Ohm-JS to transpile .cmmmac files into .ohm files an process from there. A first cut at what .cmmmac specs might look like is in [[cmmmac]] (https://github.com/guitarvydas/jam0002/blob/main/guitarvydas/doc/cmmmac.md)

- Convert this stuff to C++. (Is this necessary?  C++ can use raw .c files...)
