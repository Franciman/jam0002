at factorial:
11:00 I write "num" in a blank note
11:00 I open my backpack, read num, and write the value in num
11:10 I write "result" in a blank note
11:15 I notice the number in result is the number in num plus 0
11:20 I wonder if result is 1
11:30 It is! Good heavens, just look at the time! It's 12:20 already!
11:30 Otherwise it feels like time doesn't pass
11:40 I notice the number in num is slightly smaller now...
11:45 I put num in my backpack
11:50 I go to factorial
12:00 I open my backpack, read result, and write the value in num
12:10 I notice the number in result is the number in result multiplied by the number in num
12:20 I put result in my backpack
12:30 I return from factorial

08:00 I wake up
08:15 I write "num" in a blank note
08:30 I ask myself "What factorial will I calculate today?" and write the answer in num
08:40 I put num in my backpack
08:45 I go to factorial
12:35 I write "result" in a blank note
12:40 I open my backpack, read result, and write the value in result
13:10 I say "The result of " num "! is " result
13:20 I go to sleep
