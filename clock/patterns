at work:
09:05 I greet my colleagues "Good morning!"
14:00 I return from work


07:00 I wake up
07:15 I have breakfast
07:30 I brush my teeth
08:00 I go to work
15:00 I write "lunch" in a blank note
15:01 I ask myself "How much will I eat today?" and write the answer in lunch
15:02 I write "counter" in a blank note
15:05 I wonder if counter is greater or equal to lunch
15:06 It is! Good heavens, just look at the time! It's 15:58 already!
15:06 Otherwise it feels like time doesn't pass
15:10 I take a bite
15:11 I say "Yummy!"
15:12 I notice the number in counter is slightly greater now...
15:13 I realize it's 15:05 again...
15:58 I write "naptime" in a black note
15:59 I ask myself "For how long will I nap today?" and write the answer in naptime
16:00 I nap for as many hours as it's written in naptime
16:30 I watch TV
17:00 I surf the internet
17:50 I greet my grandparents "I hope you're doing good!"
18:00 I surf the internet
19:00 I watch sunset from the balcony
19:05 I say "I will make tomorrow will be even better than today ðŸŒ†"
19:20 I contemplate twilight
20:30 I write "dinner" in a blank note
20:31 I ask myself "How much will I eat today?" and write the answer in dinner
20:32 I erase counter
20:33 I wonder if counter is greater or equal to dinner
20:34 It is! Good heavens, just look at the time! It's 21:30 already!
20:34 Otherwise it feels like time doesn't pass
20:35 I take a big bite
20:36 I notice the number in counter is exactly greater by 3 now...
20:37 I quietly pet my cat
20:38 The cat purrs
20:39 I realize it's 20:33 again...
20:40 I look out the window and the sky looks so pretty tonight
21:00 I go to sleep
